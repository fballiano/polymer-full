polymer-full
============

A vulcanized version of all polymer core/paper components in a single file file.

If you want to test polymer and start prototyping a web app without having to manually include every polymer component you'll need, simply include just polymer-full and you'll be done!
You'll have all the stable components ready to use with no hassle.

Polymer-full is probably not suited for production environments, also there's a debate about vulcanize itself, cause you reduce the amount of HTTP requests but you build bigger files to download so... it's actually up to you to choose.
